# GTest Examples
This is just a small project I'm using to learn GTest and Gmock. The functionality within is arbitrary. 

## Note:
The makefile in main is OBE. I needed to learn to build GTest with only make. See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/matt256/025d8c9350c099f9d4615908c760c9a2). Will remove in future commit.
